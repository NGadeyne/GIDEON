<h1>Contributing</h1>

First off, thank you for considering contributing to GIDEON. It's people like you that make GIDEON such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

GIDEON is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into GIDEON itself.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. If your problem is not GIDEON specific, #python is generally more active. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.

<h2>Ground Rules</h2>

Technical:

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the Python Community Code of Conduct.

Human:

- Be considerate
- Be respectful
- Be collaborative
- When you disagree, consult others
- When you're unsure, ask for help
- Step down considerately

<h3>Contribute</h3>

Contact us at contact@nicolas-gadeyne.fr

<h3>Report Bug</h3>

Any security issues should be submitted directly to contact@nicolas-gadeyne.fr In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at contact@nicolas-gadeyne.fr

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

- What version of Go are you using (go version)?
- What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead? General questions should go to the golang-nuts mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.
